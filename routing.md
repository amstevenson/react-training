# Routing

Routing is about being able to show different pages to the user. Most applications have more than one page. Multiple pages in a single page application. What happens is that the single page is reloaded with the content for the provided route, and showing the appropriate JSX. 

The effective outcome is that a user will go to a route, a config will be read, and the appropriate JSX will be rendered.
